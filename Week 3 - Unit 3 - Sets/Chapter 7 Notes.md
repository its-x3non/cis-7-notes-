# Chapter 7: Sets - Notes Simplified
**Sets** - An unordered collection of objects or **elements** <br />
There are different kinds of sets that could include elements like:
- Rational Numbers
- Both Negative and Positive Integers
- Rational Numbers
- Real Numbers
- Letters

We use **braces (curly brackets, aka these -> `{ }`)** to show the elements of a set.

# Set Basics
**x ∈ S** - if x is an element of S (x is in S) <br />
**x ∉ S** - if x is NOT in S <br />

Two sets are only **equal** if they both  **have the same elements**: 
`{a, b, c} = {b, c, a} = {c, b, a}` <br />

 **Finite Set** - A set that has a **finite number of elements**. The **cardinality or size** of the set is the **number of elements it contains**.  <br />
- To denote the cardinality of S, we use **| S |** - If `S = {1, 2, 5, 7}` then | S | = 4 <br />

**Cardinality** is also defined for **infinite sets** which are just sets with **infinitely many elements**.
- Even though both R and Z have infinitely many elements, they do not have the same cardinality. In fact, there are an infinite number of different infinities, based on **Theory of Computation**. <br />

**Empty Set** - a set with no elements at all. Denoted with: ∅ or `{ }` <br />

When you declare a set variable in computing, it is an empty set until you put something in it. <br />
