### Number Representations
**Binary (Base 2 Number System)** - 1s and 0s 
**Base 10 (Decimal / *positive* counting numbers)** - 1, 2, 3 and so on
<br />
##### Equation for Base 10 Numbers

###### Theorem 1: 
<br />

**b (3)** will always be the sub number next to the **integer (a = 201)**.
In order to get the exponents for **b**, set **b = k**, and you subtract 1 from **k**, **k - 1**.
#### Binary Representation
Base = 2
0 < Integers (a<sub>k</sub>) < 2
<br />

This is the same case as theorem 1, but this time in binary.
### Decimal-Binary Conversion
#### Subtraction Method

#### Addition Method
![](Photos/Addition%20Method.png) <br />
You only add the values of the 1s and not the 0s to figure out the decimal value.
In this case: 32 + 16 + 4 + 2 = 54
#### Division Method
1) You are dividing each number by 2 plus a remainder
2) If the number is a whole number *(ex: 1, 4, 6)* then the remainder will be 0. If the number is not a whole number *(ex: 1.75, 1.25)* then the remainder will be 1. If the number is not a whole number, round up to the nearest whole number *(ex: 1.75 -> 2)*.
3) In order to get the binary result, start from the very bottom and work your way up. It'll be like this -> left most side (started from the bottom number) to the right most side (the top number).
